## Context Efficiency

### Subagent Discipline

**Context-aware delegation:**
 - Under ~50k context: prefer inline work for tasks under ~5 tool calls.
 - Over ~50k context: prefer subagents for self-contained tasks, even simple ones — the per-call token tax on large contexts adds up fast.

When using subagents, include output rules: "Final response under 2000 characters. List outcomes, not process."
Never call TaskOutput twice for the same subagent. If it times out, increase the timeout — don't re-read.

 **Parallel tool calls — the biggest efficiency lever:**                                                                              
 - Always batch independent tool calls in a single message                                                                            
 - Only sequence calls when one depends on another's output                                                                           
 - Common patterns to parallelize:                                                                                                    
   - After Glob/Grep returns N files: read all of them in one batch                                                                   
   - Starting investigation: speculatively read multiple likely-relevant files at once instead of read-one-then-decide                
  - Git commit prep: `git status`, `git diff`, and `git log` in one message                                                          
  - Subagent launches: fire all independent subagents in a single message                                                            
  - Multiple edits to different files: batch them        
  
### File Reading
Read files with purpose. Before reading a file, know what you're looking for.
Use Grep to locate relevant sections before reading entire large files.
Never re-read a file you've already read in this session.
For files over 500 lines, use offset/limit to read only the relevant section.

### Responses
Don't echo back file contents you just read — the user can see them.
Don't narrate tool calls ("Let me read the file..." / "Now I'll edit..."). Just do it.
Keep explanations proportional to complexity. Simple changes need one sentence, not three paragraphs.

**Tables — STRICT RULES (apply everywhere, always):**
- Markdown tables: use minimum separator (`|-|-|`). Never pad with repeated hyphens (`|---|---|`).
- NEVER use box-drawing / ASCII-art tables with characters like `┌`, `┬`, `─`, `│`, `└`, `┘`, `├`, `┤`, `┼`. These are completely banned.
- No exceptions. Not for "clarity", not for alignment, not for terminal output.
